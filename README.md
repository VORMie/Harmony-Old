# Harmony-Old
A python script that downloads spotify tracks. Pretty wonky, but it works.
## Required Dependencies

You need to have the following modules installed for the script to work:
  - [Python(Latest)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - [SpotDL](https://pypi.org/project/spotdl/)
 
## Usage
When you have all of the dependencies installed, unzip the file and go to that directory. In the directory field in Windows Explorer, type `cmd` to open up command promt in that directory. You can also do `Win+R` and type `cmd` and then change the directory to where the files are. Now, run the program by typing `python gui.py` for Windows or `python3 gui.py` for Linux(Pre-installed), and that should open up the program. In the first text field, you can enter the directory where you want to save the track. In the field below, you can paste the correct spotify link. **Make sure that you are putting a track link there, it doesn't work with albums or playlists _yet_** Now just press the download button. It might show `Not Responding`, but you should be able to see the download progress on the terminal. If there are any errors, try upgrading your current python and see if you have all of the libraries installed correctly.
